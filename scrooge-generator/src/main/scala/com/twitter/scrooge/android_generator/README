# Android Java Generator

A new Android code generator based on ApacheJavaGenerator.  The main reason of providing
separate generator is due to the limiation of number of methods on Android dex.
Apache generator produces 6 extra methods per each field, but Android generator only
creates fixed number of methods per struct by providing struct level builders, getters and
setters.

List of differences between ApacheJavaGen and AndroidGen
1. Removed all field level getters / setters
2. Added class level Builder.
3. Provided Setter for all fields of the struct within Builder.
  e.g.
    public Builder putTo(_Fields field, Object key, Object value) { ... }

    public Builder set (_Fields field, Object value) {
      switch(field) {
        case LOGS: {
          if (value != null) {
            this.logs = (Map<String,List<ByteBuffer>>) value;
          }
          break;
        }
        ...
      }
      return this;
    }
4. Provided single generic getter for entire struct.
    public <Any> Any get(_Fields field) {
      switch(field) {
        case LOGS:
            Any rval_logs = (Any)((Map<String,List<ByteBuffer>>) getFieldValue(field));
            return rval_logs;
        ...
      }
    }
5. ApacheGenerator uses EnumSet for Set type in order to improve space efficiency, but it
   relies on scrooge runtime library, which is not available on Android.  We will keep
   HashSet for SetType for now, but it should be revisited to use EnumSet without relying
   on scrooge runtime lib.
